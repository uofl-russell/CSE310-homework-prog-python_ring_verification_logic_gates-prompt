# CSE 310 - Verification Of Rings
This assignment will test your ability to create code that will test whether a set and two binary logic gate operations (+ and *) form a mathematical ring.

# Product Owner Statement
As a person interested in logic gates and mathematical rings I would like to have a program that determines whether the set {0,1} (representing false and true) form a ring given two operations from the set of 16 possible binary logic gates.

# Acceptance Criteria
The following details the requirements

- The student must create two new operation tables.  The new files must be similar in construction to the AND.py and XOR.py files.  The new files must be named XNOR.py and OR.py and represent the obvious operation.
- The output format of ring_test.py should not be altered.
- The only changes to ring_test.py should be limited to the import statements.
